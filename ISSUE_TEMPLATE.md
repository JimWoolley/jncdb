_edit out everything but one of the templates_

These are example templates only, feel free to add general issues. 

At present there are two types of primary issues we're tracking:
1) Problems with data representation - as data are migrated from UCD to JNCDB there were issues
2) Problems with the application (errors returned, inablity to do X, suggestions for more efficient Y, requests for features)

For issues of 2) you might consider filing an issue directly here [https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/issues](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/issues).  We will migrate issues from here to there as applicable.
